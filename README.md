# Pokemon_map_tracker
This will be an implementation of a Pokemon map tracker for a pokemon Map randomizer.

## Planned features
- GUI where all the locations can be added by choosing a folder
- All pictures should have the place as file name.
- by draging one picture to another there should be created a connection
- there should be two input fields to input the start point and the end point. Then an alogirthm should find the fastest way from one point to an other. 
- the found way should be showed as a picture line on the screen
- the algorithm which finds the way will be dikstra

## Pictures name rules
The names of the pictures which reperesent a specific place should have a certain name scheme.
place_direction

An example will look like this:
- Cherrygrove_PC
- Goldenrod-mall-e4_down
- MtMortar-floor2_right-top
